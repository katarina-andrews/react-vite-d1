# React + Vite
I made a very simple web app with an embedded video using minimal setup to get React working in Vite.

## How I Went About Doing it 
- **First:** I used ```npm create vite@latest react-vite-d1 -- --template react``` to set up React
- **Second:** After opening on vscode I used the command ```npm run dev``` to get local host
- **Third:** I removed everything from both css files and ```App.jsx```.
- **Fourth:** I made a components folder within the src folder. I then made two component files: ```Greeting.jsx``` and ```Body.jsx```.
- **Fifth:** After that, I made a function in each component file and imported them to ```App.jsx```. 
- **Sixth:**. Lastly, I added simple styling to ```App.css``` and imported it to ```App.jsx```.


Sidenote: ran into a problem where I had to delete the ```node_modules``` folder and ```package-lock.json``` file and reinstall them.
